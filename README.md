- Task 4: Create simple movement for the first weapon.
-	The movement of rotation was completed for the fireball subsequently by my third task. So, the Task 4 branch was not moved to 'complete' during this sprint.
-	The task was still completed, but I will use the branch to update the movement even further to project forward form the main character sprite.

- Task 1: Polish up the hitbox of the player

- Task 2: Create simple movement for the first weapon. 
- Note: This was the most complex task I had to complete, so I wanted to do it second (earlier in the sprint).
        I created a class diagram to cure my confusion as to which class files would handle which aspects of the fireballs' "projectiles" list. It only seemed right for the player to have direct capability to create and manupulate the fireball data so that the Player class instance "freddy" could seemingly gain the powers of fire-bending. The level1 file is where the bulk of the scripting occurs like writing the central story elements and establishing the characters and world-building.

- Task 3: Create walk cycle for alternate player color: start the game green, then "Flame On!".

- Task 4: Make the fireball powerup have a animation when the player presses F.
- Note: This task was challenging because I had to figure out how to pause the rest of the game loop 
        while the player powered up.

- Task 5: Implement the winner music!
- Note: I implemented this in two places, checking for fireball collision with the boss and checking for sword collision with the boss. I think this could have been refined to one set of statements checking the bosses health after damage collision checking for the sword and fireballs separately. (cleaner code)
